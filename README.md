XSLT and XQuery Specifications - the source used to build the specs, and the errata

Individual specs can be found under specifications; you can view them at htmlpreview.github.io, e.g. with
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/w3c/qtspecs/blob/master/specifications/xslt-30/html/Overview.html
or
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/w3c/qtspecs/blob/master/specifications/xquery-31/html/xquery-31.html

This repo, GitHub/qt4cg/qtspecs, is a clone/fork of the W3C qtspecs repo, created for development of 4.0 proposals by the W3C xslt-40 community group established by Michael Kay.
