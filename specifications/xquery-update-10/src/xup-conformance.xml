    <p>This section defines the conformance criteria for an XQuery processor. In this section, the
        following terms are used to indicate the requirement levels defined in
        <bibref ref="RFC2119"/>. <termdef id="must" term="must">
            <term>MUST</term> means that the item is an absolute requirement of the specification.</termdef>
        <termdef id="may" term="may">
            <term>MAY</term> means that an item is truly optional.</termdef>
        <termdef id="should" term="should">
            <term>SHOULD</term> means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
            to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully
            weighed before choosing a different course.</termdef>
    </p>
   
    <p>An XQuery processor that claims to conform to this specification
        <termref def="must">MUST</termref> include a claim of Minimal Conformance as defined in
        <specref ref="id-minimal-conformance"/>. In addition to a claim of Minimal Conformance, it
        <termref def="may">MAY</termref> claim conformance to one or more optional features

                and <specref ref="id-xquf-xqueryx"/>. If an
                implementation does not provide a given optional
                feature, it <termref def="must">MUST</termref>
                implement any requirements specified in <specref

	      <p>A definition of every item specified to be implementation-defined,

                <note>
                    <p>Implementations are not required to define

If this becomes a <loc href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/tr.html#RecsW3C">Recommendation</loc>, then we plan to say that new processors <termref def="must">SHOULD</termref> implement it; it will be optional only to avoid making existing processors non-conformant. It is likely that this function will be required in XQuery 1.1.</p>
