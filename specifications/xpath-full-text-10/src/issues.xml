<issue id="window" status="open">
	<head>Window</head> <p>Currently, FTDistanceSpec only permits
	a single distance specification for all of the terms specified
	by an FTSelection.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>

        <p>("dog" &amp;&amp; "cat" &amp;&amp; "bird") with word
        distance at most 10</p>

        <p>In this scenario above, the terms "dog", "cat", and "bird"
        must all occur within 10 words of one another.</p>
        
        <p>However, if one would want to return documents where "dog"
	occurs within 10 words of "cat" and this SAME "cat" term
	occurs within 5 words of "bird", it is currently not possible
	with the current language specification.  The best that could
	be done is the following:</p>

        <p>(("dog" &amp;&amp; "cat") with word distance at most 10) and
           (("cat" &amp;&amp; "bird") with word distance at most 5)</p>
 
        <p>But, this will not lead to the exact desired result because
	the "cat" and "bird' comparison will not use only those "cat"
	terms which occurred within 10 positions of "dog" ... it can
	use any "cat" term within the search context.</p>

        <p>We need some indirection to

	way to define a thesaurus, then specify it in the query - an
	indirection.  Steve Buxton proposes there are many classes of
	things that are needed for context-match (stoplist, special
	characters, etc.) that need an indirection. So we need an
	extra level of indirection - a named policy that refers to a
	set of named things.</p>

	<head>Loose Grammar</head> <p>The grammar allows lots of

        word distance N", "dog within word distance N", "(dog || cat)
        ordered", "!dog 5 times" If the grammar does not provide a way
        of identifying these "nonsense queries", then the
        implementation still has to identify them - i.e. implementors
        will have to augment the grammar to identify nonsense queries,
        and augment the semantics to do something with them.  </p><p>

	<head>Precendence of XQuery and full-text</head> <p> We need
	to distinguish between XQuery expressions embedded in

	distinguish between these two expressions. See his message in
	http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-query-fttf/2004Apr/0042.html
	and subsequent messages.  A simple example is to distinguish

<head> What should we call the mild not</head>
<p>The name "mild not" or "mild negation" is not really helpful in
understanding what we want it to denote. We should try hard to find a
better name for this construct. Since it is used to exclude certain
matches, why not call it "FTMatchExclude" or just "FTExclude"? Keeping
"mild not" as the name makes it recognizable as a form of "not". If it
remains as "mild not" and the ! continues as the syntax for "not",
consider using mild! as the syntax for "mild not".</p>

        <head>Thesauri lookup for multi-word phrases</head>
       <p>It should be decided whether thesauri lookups can be performed
              only on single words or whether it is possible to apply it on
              multi-word phrases. For example, should we allow the 
thesaurus to
              replace "bells and whistles" with "frills"?  </p>
        <p>In the latter case, should thesauri lookup be applied only to 
the
               FTWord "bells andwhistles", or should it applied also on
               ("bells" "and" "whistles") phrase? Another question is if
               the thesauri expansion can be applied on phrase and on a word
               in the phrase, which one takes precedence. </p>

	<head>Proper semantics of double negation</head>
	<p>Currently, (! ! Q) does not produce the same AllMatches as
	  (Q). There seem to be two reasons for that. First, there are 
	   duplicate StringIncludes, StringExcludes, and Matches. Second, 
	   there are Matches that are subsumed by other Matches (i.e. 
	   the former are a logical consequence of the latter). How
	   do we handle these situations? It seems reasonable to expect 
	   that !!Q produces the same result as Q.</p>
