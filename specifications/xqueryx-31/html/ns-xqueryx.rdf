This schema specifies the XML syntax of the XQuery expressions defined in
[XQuery 3.1]. 
It is located at
http://www.w3.org/2017/03/XQueryX/xqueryx.xsd.



Queries written using the XML syntax of [XQuery 3.1] have semantics
that are defined by the XQuery "human-readable" syntax that results from transforming
those XML syntax queries using the stylesheet located at
http://www.w3.org/2017/03/XQueryX/xqueryx.xsl.

The W3C reserves the right to define additional names in this namespace in the future. 
[XQueryX 3.1]
is the only specification that is permitted to amend this namespace.
It may, however, be augmented by other specifications that define XQueryX 3.1 extensions
corresponding to XQuery 3.1 extensions.
