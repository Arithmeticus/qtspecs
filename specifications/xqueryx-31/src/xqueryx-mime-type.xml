     XQueryX is the XML syntax of a language, XQuery, for querying over

    <head>Introduction</head>

    <p>This document, together with its normative references, defines the
       XML syntax for the XML Query language <phrase  diff="chg" at="2014-04-24">XQuery Version 3.1</phrase>. 
       This Appendix specifies the <code>application/xquery+xml</code> media type,
       which is intended to be used for transmitting queries expressed in the
       XQueryX syntax.</p>

    <head>Registration of MIME Media Type <code>application/xquery+xml</code></head>

    <p>MIME media type name:  <code>application</code></p>

    <p>MIME subtype name:    <code>xquery+xml</code></p>

    <p>Required parameters:  none</p>

    <p>Optional parameters: <code>charset</code></p>

    <p>This parameter has identical semantics to the
       <code>charset</code> parameter of the <code>application/xml</code>
       media type as specified in [RFC 3023].</p>


    <div3 id="xqueryx-mime-encoding">
      <head>Encoding Considerations</head>

      <p>By virtue of XSLT content being XML, it has the same considerations
      when sent as "<code>application/xquery+xml</code>" as does XML. 
      See [RFC 3023], section 3.2.</p>

    <div3 id="xqueryx-mime-security" diff="chg" at="bug29893">
      <head>Security Considerations</head>

        <p>Queries written in XQuery may cause arbitrary URIs or IRIs to be dereferenced. 
           Therefore, the security issues of [RFC 3987] Section 8 should be considered. 
           In addition, the contents of resources identified by <code>file:</code> URIs can in
           some cases be accessed, processed and returned as results. 
           XQuery expressions can invoke any of the functions defined in
           <phrase diff="chg" at="2014-04-24"><bibref ref="xpath-functions-31"/></phrase>.
           For example, the <code>fn:doc()</code> and <code>fn:doc-available()</code> functions  
           allow local filesystem probes as well as access to any URI-defined resource accessible 
           from the system evaluating the XQuery expression.

           <phrase diff="add" at="bug 30027">
           The <code>fn:transform()</code> function allows calls to
           URI-identified XSLT transformations which may in turn call
           external extension functions and access or write to the
           file system. The <code>fn:transform()</code> function
           should be sandboxed or disabled if untrusted queries are
           run.
           </phrase>
        </p>

        <p>XQuery is a full declarative programming language, and supports
           user-defined functions, external function libraries (modules)
           referenced by URI, and system-specific "native" functions. </p>

        <p>Arbitrary recursion is possible, as is arbitrarily large
           memory usage, and implementations may place limits on CPU and
           memory usage, as well as restricting access to system-defined functions. </p>

        <p>
           The optional XQuery Update Facility allows XQuery expressions to
           create and update persistent data, potentially including writing
           to arbitrary locations on the local filesystem as well as to
           remote URIs. Untrusted queries should not be given write access
           to data.
        </p>

        <p>Furthermore, because the XQuery language permits extensions, it is
           possible that <code>application/xquery+xml</code> may describe content 
           that has security implications beyond those described here. </p>

      <p>This media type registration is for XQueryX documents as described
         by the <phrase diff="chg" at="2014-04-24">XQueryX 3.1 specification, which is located at
         <loc href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xqueryx-31/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xqueryx-31/</loc></phrase>. 
         It is also appropriate to use this media type with later versions of

      <head>Applications That Use This Media Type</head>

    	<p>The public <loc href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/">XQuery Web page</loc>
         lists more than two dozen implementations of the XQuery language,
	       both proprietary and open source.  Some of these are known to
         support XQueryX. </p>

  	  <p>This new media type is being registered to allow for deployment
	       of XQueryX on the World Wide Web.</p>

      <p>There is no experimental, vendor specific, or personal tree
         predecessor to "application/xquery+xml", reflecting the fact
         that no applications currently recognize it. This new type is
         being registered in order to allow for the expected deployment
         of <phrase diff="chg" at="2014-04-24">XQueryX 3.1</phrase>
         on the World Wide Web, as a first class XML application. </p>

        <p>Although no byte sequences can be depended on to consistently
           identify XQueryX, XQueryX documents will have the sequence
           "http://www.w3.org/2005/XQueryX" to identify the XQueryX
           namespace. 
           This sequence will normally be found in a namespace attribute
