   http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8810#c2. Need to
   refer to LEIRI spec. (for XQuery 1.1 and XPath 2.1)

   *** POSTPONE **** -- editorial, not much mileage here ...

   The relevant portion for XQuery is here:

   Second, several specs (XQuery, XSLT, F+O) make frequent reference
   to "resolving" a URI. These references can easily be found by
   searching (but take care, because the word is also used in other
   senses, e.g. resolving a namespace prefix). I propose that each of
   these specs contains the definition:

   [DEFINITION: to *resolve* a relative URI is to expand it to an
   absolute URI, by reference to a base URI, as if by calling the
   function fn:resolve-uri.]

   and that appropriate uses of the term resolve should be linked to
   this definition. The definition can go in 2.4.5 URI Literals for
   XQuery, in 6 Functions that manipulate URIs for F+O, and in 5.8 URI
   References for XSLT.

** TODO 

   ACTION A-444-04: Jonathan to add text to XPath to the effect: You
   can label your functions as non-deterministic.  Implementations may
   use this information when optimizing expressions. For example, it
   may be significant how many times a non-deterministic function is
   executed or in what order.  SCHEDULED: <2010-09-07 Tue>

*** TODO Clarify?



** DONE ACTION A-444-15: Jonathan to close 9252 to reflect the decision not to require errors to be raised in non-matching case operands.
   SCHEDULED: <2010-09-03 Fri>  CLOSED: [2010-09-03 Fri 16:34]


** DONE DECISION (Bugzilla Bug 8221, "deterministic / stable") - 
   CLOSED: [2010-11-11 Thu 13:40]
   deterministic and nondeterministic [[
    A fn is deterministic if all calls within an execution scope
    and with identical arguments return an identical result.
    That result may be implementation defined/depedent
    (e.g. in the order of items in a sequence)

    If the function is dependent on the dynamic context, we
    regard it as deterministic treating that part of the context
    as an implicit argument, so if the context and arguments are
    the same the result must be the same.

    All other functions are non-deterministic.

    Side-effecting and determinism are orthogonal

** DONE DECISION: close 9816, "[XQuery] Is there really a need to prohibit 
   CLOSED: [2010-11-11 Thu 13:52]
   checking of NOTATIONs during validation?": the sentence prohibiting 
   the check that notation
   names are declared is to be removed from XQuery 1.1, and queued
   as a pending erratum for XQuery 1.0.

** TODO DECIDED Bug 9302, "[XQuery11] How are output declarations processed?"

   We adopt w3c-xsl-query/2010Jul/0159.html as the solution to
   http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9302, modulo the
   following corrections:

    "output:parameter-document =":

        should be no =

    Various schema corrections - now found here:

    http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/qtspecs/specifications/xslt-xquery-serialization-11/html/Overview.html#serparams-in-xdm-instance

    Refer to above.


** TODO DECISION - move serialization options (XQuery C3) to the static context. 

   Module scope. Implementations are allowed to overwrite or
   augment. Consistency rules column needs to be filled in.

    functions and declared/imported/constructor functions
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2010Sep/0016.html et seq

    Jonathan, Mike and Michael to co-ordinate and ensure that they agree
    on the wording.

** TODO DECISION:  J4.4.4 ACTION A-444-04: Jonathan to add text to XPath to the 
    effect: You can label your functions as non-deterministic. 
    Implementations may use this information when optimizing expressions. 
    For example, it may be significant how many times a non-deterministic 
    function is executed or in what order.

    The working group agree that ACTION-444-04 can be closed with no
    further changes to the document

** TODO DECISION: J4.4.6 Bugzilla Bug 10571, 
    [XPath21] Need a precise definition of what a ParenthesizeItemType matches
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10571

    Adopt the suggested solution in the bug (adding a new bullet at the
    end of 2.5.4.2 that reads, "A ParenthesizedItemType matches an item
    if and only if the item matches the ItemType that is in
    parentheses."), and then close the bug.

** TODO DECISION: J4.4.7 Bugzilla Bug 10579, 
    [XPath21] The closure of a function item should be defined http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10579

    The bug can be closed by transforming the note (the definition of a
    closure in section 2.8 of internal last call draft of Data Model)
    into a proper definition and linking to it.

** TODO DECISION: Q2.6.2 Bugzilla Bug 10271, 
    [XQuery11]: Wrong error for duplicate decimal format declarations 
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10271

    [XQuery11]: Missing error for duplicate property names within a single declaration? 
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10272

    Jonathan will define a new error/select an existing error for this
    situation and mark the bug RESOLVED FIXED.

    [XQuery11]: Mistaken allowance of missing DFPropertyName pair in EBNF? 
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10273

    Bug reclassified as editorial. Jonathan to record the solution and
    mark the bug RESOLVED FIXED.

** TODO DECISION: Q2.6.5 Bugzilla Bug 10407, 
    [XQuery11] Consistency constraint for external variables needs to consider default value 
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10407

    Adopt the solution in comment #2, changing the last sentence

    If the variable declaration does not include a declared type, the
    external environment must provide a type and a matching value, using
    the same matching rules.

    to

    The external environment may provide a value of any type.

** TODO DECISION: Q2.6.6 Bugzilla Bug 10466, 
    [XQuery11] Are inline functions "user defined" and is a "user defined" function the same thing as a "user-declared" function? 
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10466

      Eliminate the term "user-declared".  "User-defined" are functions
      with a body.

    [XPath21] Section on input sources doesn't mention new functions 
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10503

    also refer to fn:unparsed-text, fn:uri-collection and
    fn:get-environment-variable).

    element/function namespace
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10683

    RESOLVED: We'll define "absent", that absent refers to the state
    of a property that has no value, and will mention that we use this
    particularly with respet to namepace URIs. And that we replace
    uses of "null", "empty", or "none" wrt namespace URIs with

    not define which error to use if it is a single value
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10689

    RESOLVED: The Working Groups decided to remove error codes from
    the discussion of static context completely - errors are
    defined in "4.10 Decimal-Format Declaration". 12:47 PM In 4.10,
    error XQST0097 already covers this case, so there is no need to
    change the text in that section.

    override the precedence rules".

** TODO DECISION: change "an expression" to "Query Body" in XQuery 2.3.1:
     "Independently of whether the Static Typing Feature is in effect, if an
     implementation can determine during the static analysis phase that the
     evaluation of the QueryBody would necessarily raise a type error or a
     dynamic error, the implementation may (but is not required to) 
report that
     error during the static analysis phase. However, the fn:error() 
function
     must not be evaluated during the static analysis phase."

     This does not close

This text was further refined by the following decision:

** TODO DECISION: Change text in 2.3.1:
   Independently of whether the Static Typing Feature is in effect, if 
an implementation can determine during the static analysis phase that an 
expression, if evaluated, would necessarily raise a type error or a 
dynamic error, the implementation may (but is not required to) report 
that error during the static analysis phase.
   - to -
   Independently of whether the Static Typing Feature is in effect, if 
an implementation can determine during the static analysis phase that a 
query body, if evaluated, would necessarily raise a dynamic error or an 
expression, if evaluated, would necessarily raise a type error, the 
implementation may (but is not required to) report that error during the 
static analysis phase.

** TODO DECISION: Remove the sentence "However, the fn:error() function must not 
be evaluated during the static analysis phase." from 2.1.3, and add a 
note to illustrate the differences introduced by the first sentence.

** TODO DECISION: Change the following sentance (XQuery 4.15):
Implementations can add their own annotations, which should not be in 
the fn namespace.
- to -
Implementations can add their own annotations, which must not be in any 
of the following namespaces:
   *  http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace
   *  http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
   *  http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance

** TODO DECISION: Change the last sentence in 2.5.3:
Users should avoid creating annotation assertions in the fn namespace, 
since this namespace is reserved for future language extensions.
- to -
Users must not create annotation assertions in the following namespaces 
[XQST0045]:
   *  http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace
   *  http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
   *  http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance

** TODO DECISION: Prohibit the xmlns namespace in EQNames.  Raise the error 
XQST0070 in this case.

** TODO DECISION:  Change the definitions of public/private functions as so:
[Definition: A private function is a function with a %private
annotation.  A private function is hidden from module import, which
can not import it into the function signatures of another module.]
[Definition: A public function is a function without a %private 
annotation. A public function is accessible to module import, which can 
import it into the function signatures of another module. ]

** TODO DECISION: Allow multiple private functions to be declared with the same 
name providing that they are in different modules.

** TODO DECISION: Reword the text describing deterministic and non-determinstic 
text to distinguish the terms from the annotations %deterministic and 
%non-deterministic.

** TODO DECISION: Wherever annotations are used, add text restricting the set of 
annotations allowed in the fn namespace to the set which have a defined 
meaning.

** TODO DECISION: Prohibit user defined functions from being declared in the 
math namespace.

** TODO DECISION: Adopt the rules outlined in bug 10885 comment #0 to define the 
behaviour of depends on in the presence of function items.

** TODO DECISION: Jonathan to fix the group-by example listed in bug 10980 using 
Andrew's report as a guide.

** TODO DECISION: Jonathan to remove the default value from annotations, explain 
how he will fix bug 11014 and mark the bug resolved fixed.
