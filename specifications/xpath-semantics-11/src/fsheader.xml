    <p>JS January 2005. Major revision, aligning the Formal Semantics
    with decisions taken up to October 2004.</p>

    <p>JS April 22/2003: Revised version implementing decisions from
    the December 2002 and March 2003 f2f meetings.</p>

    <p>JS November 4/2002: Revised version implementing decisions from
    the September 2002 f2f meeting in North Carolina.</p>

    <p>JS July 26/2002: Revised version which implements most of the
    recent decisions of the XML Query and XSLT working groups. Notably
    implements semantics of element constructors.</p>

    <p>JS June 15/2002: Revised version which fixes many problems
    pointed out by reviewers. Revised version of Sections 4.3 and
    4.13.</p>

    <p>JS May 05/2002: New major revision which integrates named
    typing, mapping from XML Schema and the semantics of XPath
    2.0.</p>

    <p>JS March 22/2002: Most of the document is new. This is the
    basis for the new Formal Semantics of XPath 2.0 and XQuery
    1.0. The current version is up to date and aligned with the
    December 2002 XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 working drafts.</p>
  
    <p>JS January 2002: Comprehensive editorial rewrite. Update to
    align the formal semantics with the new &language; language
    document. Update to align the formal semantics with the new
    &xq_functions; document. Update to align the formal semantics with
    XML Schema.</p>

    <p>DD August 2001: Comprehensive editorial rewrite.  Introduced
    new section <specref ref="sec_preliminaries"/> with new text and
    amalgamated material that was previously spread over the entire
    document.  Merged previously separate static, dynamic, and core
    rewrite sections into a single section.  Switched to the type
    system and syntax as defined J&eacute;r&ocirc;me's presentation
    from the last face-to-face. Text is marked according to various
    properties:</p>
    <slist>
      <sitem role="newtext">Substantially new text.</sitem>
      <sitem role="iffy">Text that seems likely to be somewhat controversial.</sitem>
      <sitem role="missing">Areas where there is known to be missing text.</sitem>
      <sitem role="notdone">Old text, dropped into position, but not yet incorporated.</sitem>
    </slist>
