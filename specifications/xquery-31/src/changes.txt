** DONE DECISION: Clarify the spec editorially to resolve bug 24199.

   FunctionBody is present in 3.1.7 Inline Function Expressions for
   both XPath 3.1 and XPath 3.0

** DONE DECISION: Clarify the spec editorially to resolve bug 24221.

** DONE DECISION: Arrays are functions, but not maps.

** DONE DECISION: If you want a sparse array, use a map. Sparse arrays are not
   directly supported as an array.

** DONE DECISION: $a("blue") raises a type error as Arrays act as functions,
   but the array function takes an integer and not a string
   -> Jonathan believes we also decided $a(n) raises dynamic error if out of bounds

** DONE DECISION: fn:boolean of Maps, Arrays and Functions is a Type Error.

** DONE DECISION: fn:data($array) => sequence($array) ! fn:data(.)

** DONE DECISION: We will use the symbols `=>` as a mechanism for postfix
   operator use of functions, e.g. `$a => seq()`.

** DONE illustrate functions from F&O together with language features
   
   In this draft, getting by with a NOTE pointing poeple to the other spec.

** DONE DECISION: Constructors for Arrays have been decided.

> [1, (), (<e3/>, 4)] => An array of 3 members, 1st is integer `1`, 2nd
> is an empty sequence, and 3rd is a sequence.
> Note: In square braces `[]`, a comma delimits array members.
>
> array { 1, (), (<e3/>, 4) } => An array of 3 members, 1st is an
> integer, 2nd is element <e3/> and the 3rd is an integer `4`.
> Note: In `array { }`, a comma is a sequence concatenation operator, as
> in the rest of the language.


** DONE DECISION: for FPWD of XQuery 3.1, use fn:serialize-json() as specified 
   in the 2012 XSLT 3.0 Working Draft:
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-xslt-30-20120710/#func-parse-json

   Note fn:parse-json() was also adopted in #564.

   In this draft, getting by with a NOTE pointing poeple to the other spec.


* MINUTES XML Query/XSL WG Joint Teleconference #564 Agenda 2014-03-11
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2014Mar/0020.html

DECISION: Adopt MikeK's proposal 
https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2014Feb/0114.html.

DECISION: Allow "?" as a binary operator with a sequence of maps on
the left and with an ncname or string literal operand expression or
parenthesizedexpr on the right.  PostfixExpr ::= Primary Expr
(Predicate | DynamicFunctionCall | MapLookup)

* Action Items

** DONE ACTION A-563-09 

Jonathan produce a version of the 3.1 requirements and
use cases with red light/green light to indicate the status of
requirements.

=> This part is easy
=> Use cases will take time

Jonathan to open a bug against XSLT 3.0 spec suggesting that map:new
is renamed to map:merge

** DONE ACTION 564-04 

Jonathan to update XPath 3.1/XQuery 3.1 to incorporate 
MikeK's proposal at 
https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2014Feb/0114.html.

** DONE ACTION 564-05: 

Jonathan to incorporate "DECISION: Allow ? as a binary operator with a
sequence fo maps on the left and with an ncname or string literal
operand expression or parenthesizedexpr on the right" into XPath
3.1/XQuery 3.1.

MapLookup
UnaryMapLookup

** TODO More map examples

** DONE exponent separator

ACTION A-560-02: Jonathan to add the exponent separator character to 
the dynamic context.

Status: Pending; ETA 2014-03-21


** DONE fn:put() conformance

ACTION A-554-03: Jonathan to add fn:put() to the conformance section

** DONE Diff Markup

"at"  - using diffs

** TODO How often should we say this?

    <note><p diff="add" at="2014-04-01">Atomization converts arrays to sequences (see <termref def="dt-atomization">Atomization</termref>).</p></note>

Kill some of this.  Maybe all of it, and say this more centrally in the Atomization section, repeating in Arrays.


** DONE Log

** DONE binary value comparisons in operators table

   Add these to the operators table:
