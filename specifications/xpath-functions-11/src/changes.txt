------

1.  Bug 7350: remove partial-apply() function. Waiting to see the replacement syntax in the language spec. DONE (F).

2.  done
               
3.  done
               
4.  ACTION A-423-03 on all editors of x.1 specs to
               add list of incompatibilities and major
               differences between x.0 and x.1 versions. Done (but needs to be maintained).
               
5.  Add unparsed-text() and unparsed-text-available() functions from XSLT. (Bug 9067) (DONE F)

6.  Remove sentence about bold italic, and references to static typing rules in FS. (Bug 9056) DONE (F)

7. In the minutes of teleconference #412 on 2009-09-29,  
Decided to accept proposal for uri-collection() with a
slight modification. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2009Jul/0054.html (DONE F)

Add that there is no requirement of the order of the result
is the same as for the collection function, both are implementation
dependent.

8. (duplicate of 5)

9. Bug 9183 string-to-QName constructor no longer requires a string literal - 
   changes in comments #1 and #2 agreed 2010-04-13  DONE (F)

10. Add get-environment-variable() function (agreed 2010-05-04) (DONE F)

12. Bug 9571 zero-argument node-name(), data(), and document-uri() agreed 2010-05-14 (DONE F)

To be done
==========

Support for xs:dateTimeStamp from XSD 1.1

Proposal: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2009Feb/0055.html
Minutes: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2009Feb/0068.html

Allowing implementations to support XSD 1.1 means we need some (holding) statement about how
they handle precisionDecimal. 

From Oxford F2F minutes:

ACTION editors to use these terms (execution scope,
deterministic/non-deterministic, focus-dependent/focus-independent,
context-dependent, context-independent) to classify the existing
functions and to express stable/deterministic in terms of them. 


Bug 10073 (decision omitted from draft minutes):

(a) on the substantive points 6 and 7 raised by the originator, we decided to refer to the
 IEEE 708 specification for the rules on the precision of the results of trigonometric
  (and other similar) functions. We will allow anything that IEEE allows (that is,
   any of the rounding schemes it recognizes) at implementor discretion.

(b) on the new functions proposed in comment #6, we decided to include exp, exp10, log,
 log10, pow, powr, and atan2, using the IEEE definitions. (There was a suggestion that
  pow and powr could be overloads of a single function, but no decision on this as I
  recall.)
