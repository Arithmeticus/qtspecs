ACTION-SWAT1027-05 on Jonathan to correct and add values functions to
the query (transforming Arrays to HTML Tables).

ACTION-SWAT1027-04 on Jonathan to correct this example to output
well-formed JSON. (Wikipedia example)

ACTION SWAT0901-04: Ghislain to write a use case that gives an example 
of passing a map to a function that expects a function item as a parameter.

ACTION SWAT0901-02 John Snelson to turn this use case (2.5.2) into a 
requirement for the ability to provide optional parameters to functions.
Mary specifically wanted the requirement to mention the ability to pass 
function items for callbacks.

ACTION SWAT0901-01 John Snelson to enhance this use case (2.5.2) to 
discuss the significance of passing a URIResolver, the benefits of using 
maps over using an XML document (including function items and nodes with 
retained identity), and the benefits that might be obtained if stronger 
typing were possible.

Action SWAT0825-02: Mary Holstege to attempt to come up with more
compelling example for Interface/Implementation pattern, with an example
of code reuse and generic functionality.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2011Sep/0173.html

Action SWAT0908-01: John will create a section 2.7, Other Data Formats, 
and will remove editorial comment in Section 2.6.

ACTION-SWAT1117-03: John to fix the requirement to add the word "lossless".

ACTION SWAT0915-02: John to add links from the requirements to motivating use
cases.

ACTION SWAT0901-03: add a requirement that nothing in the design shall 
preclude the use of maps to represent PULs.

Requirement: There must be a convenient way to filter the members of a JSON
array.

Requirement: There must be a way to operate on the members of a JSON array in
order.

Requirement: There must be a way to insert/delete members into specific
positions in an array.

Requirement: There must be a way to operate on every member of map.

Requirement: There must be a way to access the name and value of a member of a
map.

Requirement: It should be possible to modify a small part of a deeply nested
map.

ACTION SWAT-1006-01: John to reword 1.2.3.5, removing the word Object, 
determining what belongs to the application area.

In 1.2.4.4, add an additional requirement that there is a serialization for maps
in addition to the serialization for JSON.

Resolution = keep list of operators as examples in 1.2.5.1, delete 1.2.5.2.
"no observable identity"

Proposal to delete everything after the ; in 1.2.4.3. No objection.
